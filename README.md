SfTileEngine
==============

This tile engine is very easy-to-use and almost fully customize-able. It takes advantage of SFML for event handling and rendering while supporting the importing of TMX style maps from the [Tiled Map Editor](http://mapeditor.org).

This tile engine is still in development, but I suggest downloading the source and compiling it to see how awesome it is already.

Current Features
==============
* Loading and rendering of tile map
* Simple syntax to implement the engine
* SFML for 2D graphics and event handling
* Abstract camera class for extensibility
* Preloaded "smart camera" class with many features (in progress)
* Basic TMX map support (orthogonal maps only)
* TinyXML to load XML data

Possible Features
==============
* Toggleable and customize-able mini-map
* Cinematic camera controls

Dependencies
==============
* SFML 2.0 (not included in source)
* TinyXML (included in source)
