SfTileEngine
==============

This tile engine is very easy-to-use and almost fully customize-able. It takes advantage of SFML for event handling and rendering while supporting the importing of TMX style maps from the [Tiled Map Editor](http://mapeditor.org).

This tile engine is still in development, but I suggest downloading the source and compiling it to see how awesome it is already. Plenty more features are coming in the future. A full list of current and planned features is coming soon.

Dependencies
==============
* SFML 2.0 (not included in source)
* TinyXML (included in source)
